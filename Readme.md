This project is a challange of the BeCode promo Swartz/6. I completed it on May 2022.    

The project is a web page for a restaurant, I chose to work on a wine bar with *petite restauration*.  

The website is responsive for mobile. It has five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.  

Welcome  
This is a page with one Jumbotron and two cards to show the news (promo, events).  

Menu  
This is a page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.  

Pictures  
This is a page with a gallery of 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).  

Restaurant  
Thihs is a page about the restaurants (itâ€™s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.  

Contact  
This is a page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon.  


The project is in **Bootstrap 5** at 99%. I used css only for the home page background image and for the logo's size.  

**FERMENTO** is a real wine bar that will open soon in Brussels. The only real element of my project is the logo, kindly offered by the owners.
